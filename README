=== Program Description ===

The program pft.cpp (and the library libpft that is created from it) are built to parallelize
the operation of Linux's 'file' command.


=== Performance Graph ===

=== Notes ====
In the code there is some code repetition which could have been avoided using macros and such, but 
we've decided for the sake of readability to leave it as it is.
